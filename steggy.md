Steganography is the process of hiding secret info within ordinary non-secret files to avoid detection.

In computer terms, it entails embedding a malware into a existing file so that the malware does not get detected by Windows Defender or any other antivrus provider.

Cryptography is the process of converting data from a human readable format to a non-human readable format.

There are 4 techniques in Steganography 
---
1. Least Significant Bits(LSB): this technique hides data in the LSB of pixels in an image. It is common in image steganography where altering the LSB slightly does not change the appearance of the image much.
2. Discrete Cons
